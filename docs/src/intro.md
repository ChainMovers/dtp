**What is DTP?**

It is a TCP-Like protocol facilitating data transfer between any web2 applications, with additional Web3 features such as services monetization, anonymity and security.

DTP facilitate high-level data transfer, such as audio, video, RPC calls etc...

DTP can be integrated into your own Rust/Typescript apps (frontend and/or backend).

Alternatively, you can direct your TCP/IP socket (or websocket) traffic toward a local DTP Services daemon. This daemon takes care of adding Web3 capabilities to your existing Web2 traffic (e.g. handles "per request" micro-payments).
