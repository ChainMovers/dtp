What can DTP do?</strong></p><p>It is a TCP-Like protocol facilitating data transfer between web2 applications, with additional Web3 features such as services monetization, anonymity and security.</p><p><strong>Can DTP be used between Web3 frontend apps?</strong></p><p>Yes. DTP can selectively connect front-ends WebApp to each other, while keeping the data transfer under the control of a dApps (transit on the Sui network).</p><p>As an example, you can use it to allow gamers exchange encrypted messages among themselves while they are on the same team in a Web3 game. In this case, DTP provides the WebApp to WebApp connectivity without making the players IP addresses visible.</p><p><strong>What sort of data can DTP transport?</strong></p><p>Any protocol, any data stream.</p>',8),m=r('<p><strong>Can DTP be used with commercial application?</strong></p><p>Yes. DTP is open-source and can freely be used in commercial application (<a href="../../LICENSE">Apache 2.0 License</a>).</p><p><strong>How much does it cost to use DTP?</strong></p><p>Only the Sui gas needed to run it, expect the execution cost to be mostly driven by the number of bytes transferred.</p><p>There is no developer fee or middlemen commission collected for using DTP.</p><p>Some service provider may optionally add their own fees on top of DTP (e.g. micro-payments), but DTP standardize public disclosure (and escrow management) of these fees on-chain. There is no &quot;fine print unexpected&quot; fee. A provider can not change the fees on already open DTP connections.</p><p><strong>Can DTP unexpectedly drain my account?</strong></p><p>We are working <strong>very hard</strong> to make this impossible.</p><p>DTP protects its user by enforcing a maximum amount of fee possibly collected per day (per epoch). The user must explicitly approve and sign a change to this maximum.</p><p>Also, fee rates are determine once by a Service Level Agreement (SLA) when opening a DTP connection. You can close that connection at any time. It is not possible for a service provider to keep collecting payments after a DTP connection is closed.</p><p>(Note: The configurable maximum is tied to a wallet address and enforce on-chain).</p><p><strong>When will DTP have its own token?</strong></p><p>Never.</p><p>DTP operations are always paid in Sui.</p><p>dApps built on top of DTP can use tokens, but this is not within the scope of DTP itself.</p><p><strong>Can DTP simply tunnel standard TCP, UDP, IP packets?</strong></p><p>Transparent packets tunneling could be done, but it is not recommended.</p><p>DTP/Sui provides already reliable and ordered data transport. That would be redundant with say, what TCP would try to achieve within a tunnel.</p>',18),u=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Any plan to support another blockchain?")],-1),f=e("p",null,"No, unless a breakthrough in performance is possible with another blockchain architecture.",-1),g=e("p",null,"Sui provides stable time to finality (low jitter), parallelism and scalability (no contention between connections).",-1),b=e("p",null,"Low jitter allows small and predictable buffer size at the receivers.",-1),y=e("p",null,"Sui fast path transactions makes sub-second streaming latency possible.",-1),w=e("p",null,"For now, DTP/Sui might not be well-suited for application that depends on fast sequence of query/response (since that requires two transactions finality).
