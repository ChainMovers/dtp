These are for proxy/forward/firewall services. You will simply be <em>configuring</em> how your data flows between your apps and servers. Your existing apps just use standard TCP/IP sockets (e.g. &quot;localhost:port&quot; URL) to interface with the DTP services daemon.</p></li><li><p><b>DTP Protocols</b> Think &quot;TCP&quot;. The DTP/Sui SDKs allows developers to have more control for connecting any mix of web2 apps (webapp, client/servers...). You will need to write Rust and/or Typescript apps. This is also the solution to eliminate having to install the DTP Services Daemon on your end-users&#39; devices.</p></li><li><p><b>DTP Sui Move Packages</b> Innovations particular to Sui, such as RPC escrows, new traffic policies, coins&amp;call equivocation mitigation, metering etc... you will likely be deeply involve into web3 development at this point.</p></li></ul><p>For most users, you will deal only with the &quot;easiest&quot; layer, the &quot;DTP Services Daemon&quot;.</p>',4),y={href:"https://discord.gg/Erb6SwsVbH",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f=e("h2",{id:"examples-ideas",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#examples-ideas"},[e("span",null,"Examples/Ideas")])],-1),b=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Client/Server")],-1),v=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Encrypted Messaging")],-1),_=e("ul",null,[e("li",null,'Add traditional user/password login to a dApp. The goal is to allow access to the same "user account" even if done from a different wallet (client address).
