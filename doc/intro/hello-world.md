# Hello World!

Show how to write a simple Rust application to send an "Hello World!" to a known DTP server providing echo service (reply back whatever is sent).

The Rust app will then block waiting for the response and display the received data: "Hello World!".





&#x20;\
\
Will include optional steps for:\
&#x20;  \- Access DTP debug/stats information.\
&#x20;  \- What to do if there is no node with echo service up on the network.
