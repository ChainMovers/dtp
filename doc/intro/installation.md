# Installation

### Setup for Rust App Development - All Local (Do this first!)

### Allow to run locally (with "no value" Sui gas token) two apps talking to each other (could be two instances of the same app).

Some "hard coded" pre-funded accounts are provided for convenience.



### Setup for Rust App Development - Local apps with remote Sui network

Your apps still running local, but DTP use an official remote Sui testnet/devnet or mainnet(!) for data transfer.



Your local apps operate as if they were remote from each others (assuming they are configured with different Sui address). All DTP communications are done via the remote Sui network.
