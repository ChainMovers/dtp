### L1 Network Ephemeral Data&#x20;

The notion of persisting all transactions on a ledger makes sense for traceability of financial transactions.\
\
Persistence quality is not as obvious for encrypted data after it was consumed by the intended receiver.

Data persistence might be optional (or maintain as long users are willing to access+finance its persistence on the network). \
\
At high level, the L1 network would automatically and quickly dispose of encrypted data that has no further use.\
\
One solution would be the addition (not replacement) of a new L1 network Sui consensus with a different balance of "performance vs decentralized" quality. That is, only the "heavy" transfer of "ephemeral data" would be handled by a new Sui L1 specialized consensus.\
\
Since Sui L1 network design is way beyond the control of DTP, a less ideal alternative would be to side-chaining with another L1 network specialized for data streaming.\
