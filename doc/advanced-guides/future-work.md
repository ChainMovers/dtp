# Future Work



## L1 Network Ephemeral Data&#x20;

The notion of persisting all transactions on a ledger makes sense for traceability of financial transactions.\
\
Persistence quality is not as obvious for encrypted data after it was consumed by the intended receiver.

Data persistence might be optional (or maintain as long users are willing to access+finance its persistence on the network). \
\
At high level, the L1 network would automatically and quickly dispose of encrypted data that has no further use.\
\
It is not clear yet if this will ever be possible with the Sui network and might be beyond the scope of what DTP can do (TODO: Figure this out).

## **Encrypted Broadcasting**

The broadcasted data can be independently observed by anyone subscribing to the data stream. Only the user with the decryption key will be able to make sense of the data. The distribution of the decryption key is a responsibility left to the dApps. More research to be done here how DTP could one day help mitigate (impossible to eliminate) key sharing/piracy problems \[1]\[2]**.**\
