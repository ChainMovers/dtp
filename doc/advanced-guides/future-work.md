### L1 Network Ephemeral Data&#x20;

The notion of persisting all transactions on a ledger makes sense for traceability of financial transactions.\
\
Persistence quality is not as obvious for encrypted data after it was consumed by the intended receiver.

Data persistence might be optional (or maintain as long users are willing to access+finance its persistence on the network). \
\
At high level, the L1 network would automatically and quickly dispose of encrypted data that has no further use.\
\
It is not clear yet if this will ever be possible with the Sui network and might be beyond the scope of what DTP can do (TODO: Figure this out).\
