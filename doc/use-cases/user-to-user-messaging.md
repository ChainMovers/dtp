# Applications Example

Here are a few ideas that can be built on top of DTP. If not sure how to process, please open a discussion on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Erb6SwsVbH).\
\
**Client/Server**

* Rust Client/Server.
* Rust/Typescript Web3 Client to centralized TCP Server

\
**Messaging**

* Encrypted user to user data transfer&#x20;
* Anonymous Tips Line (with potential reward in return).

****\
**Networking**

* UDP, TCP, QUIC/UDP Tunneling : Transport IP protocols packets within a DTP connection for point-to-point applications.

\
**Firewall**

* Rate limit access to a back-end server (either bandwidth or request)
* Allow/block origin (using authentication)\


**Crypto-Economics**

* Server being additionally paid: Per byte and/or per request. DTP to provide escrow service with consideration of successful delivery. Impossible to verify quality, only quantity. Client is risking only up to what has been pre-authorized at request time.
* Pre-paid subscription for a limited number of requests or bandwidth.
* Various escrow service that allow to shift the transport cost completely at the origin or destination (gas always paid by sender, but escrow service handles fair refund).\
