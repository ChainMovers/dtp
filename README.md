# Why not just use internet?
Using a blockchain has certainly drawback (not free, high latency, limited bandwidth).

The use of DTP is for when a connection would benefit fromt the advantage brought by the SUI network:
- Censorship resistant. All DTP client and server on the SUI network can freely communicate with each other. If you can't reach the SUI network, you now have free speech.

- Better protection against some DDoS attacks for your server.

- Privacy. All user-to-user DTP connections are encrypted in both directions. Nothing to setup or forget, both parties are always protected.

- Highly reliable broadcast. A broadcast data stream from a DTP server is encapsulated in a SUI network transactions. Therefore the data stream becomes globally available to anyone with the decryption key within 3 seconds.

- Optional crypto-economic for content sharing (Future)

- Anonymity (Future)
