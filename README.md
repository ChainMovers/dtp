# DTP/Sui - Decentralized Transport Protocol over Sui Network
Website: **https://dtp.dev**

Transfer your off-chain data through a decentralized network

Make your existing TCP/IP backend servers be accessible to any web3 frontend.

Protect or enhance your off-chain backends with:
  - Crypto-economics (charge per byte/request)
  - Safety with hidden IP address
  - Availability with a decentralized firewall and load balancing.
  - Authenticity and Privacy (end-to-end encryption).
  - Censorship resistance, transfer any data to anyone.
  - Solid DDoS resistance with query/response escrow
    (e.g. ping response cost pre-paid by requester)

DTP/Sui is well suited for most hybrid dApps.
