# Why not just use internet?
Using a blockchain as medium of data transfer has certainly drawback (not free, high latency, limited bandwidth).

DTP is intended to shine when a data connection needs one or more of the followings:

- Censorship resistance. All DTP clients and servers on the SUI network can freely communicate with each other. If you can reach the SUI network, you have free speech!

- Authenticity. All data transiting on the network is signed. No tampering or spoofing possible.

- Some anonymity. Users don't see each others IP address (only the SUI client service nodes do... better anonymity might one day be possible with a Dandelion/Clover transaction relay).

- UDP servers protected against all form of spoofing or amplification attacks.

- Reliable UDP delivery(!). DTP data is encapsulated in a SUI network transactions. Therefore the data becomes globally available to the receiver within 3 seconds.

- Optional crypto-economic for content sharing. Some server may generate extra revenue by publishing their content. The payment system is built-in the network. If the client retreive the data, then the content creator gets paid with finality (within a few seconds).

Finally, DTP provides end-to-end encryption. From the server machine to the client application. There is nothing to configure or forget. Always protected.
